                This is an amazing tale of how internet took over the world. The invention of World wide web was questioned by many but a little didn’t they know, that this one particular invention will change the way of living, buying, and even find love over the web for everyone. In 1993, a bunch of golf lover, computer geeks named Rob Mccool and Aleks Totic who lived in cyberspace in Illinois, were amazing by the World Wide Web who will later invent a software program that will change the internet all together. Before, Internet was not visually appealing it was all lines and lines of text with embedded links which didn’t really help people find what they were looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                A computer geek from Illinois named Marc Andreessen had an crazy idea, he imagined that everyone that will use internet as a daily life. Later, him and his buddies start to work on creating Web more interesting by adding images, video, audio compatibilities and make it easy for everyone to use, in 1993 Mosaic was release online as a free download, Andreesen gave this greatest gift to 12 people in the beginning which spread from 12 to 1 million in nine months. This got attention of Jim Clark who had a lot money from his business and wanted to invest in Mosaic because he was intrigued by how fast it was growing. Jim didn’t know how to make money from it but had great intention that there will be a way of making from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark and Clark turned Mosaic into a business venture, they were inseparable, and they need to team so they left Silicon Valley to recruit computer geeks from university of Illinois which will spark the Internet age. They hired Rob McCool and Aleks Totic for the job. Web browser would the change the world was known, even Bill Gates who invented the big tech company name Microsoft, was not interested in this technology. Web was considered as open design, but Bill Gates thought it should like highway with toll booth which individual would have to pay to surf the net. Gates online network was “MSN.COM”, Microsoft network, a lot people thought tht\at Microsoft will take over this industry as well as they have history using monopoly at their disposal. Gates was in process of launching windows 95 operating system and he was almost considered the high-tech empire.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, Jim Clark, Marc and other geeks were working on the next big thing in internet. In the next few months, they launched NETSCAPE Navigator, when it hit the streets more a million download were recorded which was obvious that everyone will turn their attention towards internet. In technology world, companies that have more power have control over software platform on other software that they run on top.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft controlled operating system platform because of their monopoly but people started to believe that Browser could be another platform which could carry all your computer needs online. Netscape success was impossible for Microsoft to ignore. Suddenly, Bill Gates got it, and not only the scale of it but what else can be achieved. He asked everyone to find a ways to be better than NETSCAPE, this started the “Browser War”.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1993, the internet was unknown and unlove but soon in 1995, things changed, Internet was becoming full scale phenomena and leading this was NETSCAPE. It became a gateway to web and the future was looking good. Garry Reback was hired by NETSCAPE; Garry had previously known that Bill Gates had a habit of coming hard on his rivals. Netscape and Microsoft had a meeting which was very daunting for Netscape as Microsoft offered 1 million to unlimited access to their technology for a one-time fee and told them, they will copy everything what they have done, and Netscape wouldn’t do anything to stop that because of the Microsoft domination. But Netscape reported this incident to the Justice Department with the help of Garry Reback. It was obvious that Microsoft saw Netscape as competition threat that need to be put down.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, Netscape was in process of laying the groundwork for lawsuit, Clark wanted to take Netscape public and later released their IPO. IPO of Netcape went through the roof, which ignited the Internet BOOM! Clark invested 5 million dollars in Netscape and at the day of closing the stock he had made close to 663 million. This sudden success filled Netscape with arrogance, and they wanted to test Microsoft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dec 7, 1995, Bill Gates would let the world know that Netscape was on their sight. Microsoft went for attack on the Pearl harbor day on Netscape. All the employees were to focus on beating Netscape and destroy it. Netscape went downhill from that, Microsoft shamed Netscape by placing a big E in their front of the office building.
            </p>
             <p>
                Internet Explorer rose and Netscape went down, later Garry filed a lawsuit against Microsoft for antitrust because Microsoft was offering internet explorer for free with their operating system which led customer to move away from Netscape. The lawsuit ended badly for Bill gates and good for Netscape. Even the higher empire can go away in a click.
