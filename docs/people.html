                Internet is about connecting individual to information and information to people. Jay Adelson, CEO, Diggs said that people trust their peers more than any unknown computer geek. Digg and YouTube were big part of the new wave of web services. They offered solution to old school media. TV host and actor/actress usually had large expense and was biased for what will go on air, but not anymore, YouTube came and changed everything because it said, “Broadcast Yourself”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before, Media companies controlled the media distribution and production, now each individual is given a broadcast tower.
            </p>
            <p>
                Diggs on the other hand was more related news and what latest going on. This was also different from regular news channel because the news was chosen by the people not some media company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, build a program where you can communicate with friends and family because their opinion matter the most and at facebook they mapped out their relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                David Weekly, Pioneer of MP3, and Cabel Sasser, co-founder of Panic Software and Justin Frankel, co-founder of Winamp had new impact of record label and music Industry. Audio-on, Winamp was created by these people. They were pushing the old way out and introducing New way of music distribution. However, this didn’t last long because record label went after Napster created by Shawn FanningWeekly and had to stop. This pave way for YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
                Era Web 2.0, Social Network, Myspace was created by Chris dellolfe and Tom Anderson, there program had more than 27 million users and it had passed YouTube & Google.
